*[OUTDATED] [PoC] Magnit bonus card numbers &amp; QR code generator and saver*

Was used "in the field" to check the bonus card balances. :)

Card numbers are bruteforced and checked on their validity using the Luhn algorithm.

QR codes are generated using "E" string + valid card number. Yes, it was that simple back in 2020. :)

User has the ability to save an image with the QR by entering the bonus card balance. Filename has the following pattern: "balance"_"card number".
